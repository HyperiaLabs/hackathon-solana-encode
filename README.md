# Hyperia Labs Behavioral Prediction Tool

This is our participation in the [Solana x Encode Hackaton](https://www.encode.club/encodesolanahack)!

## Overview

Hyperia Labs presents an advanced Behavioral Prediction. Tool that employs Deep Learning, Deep Neural network and Blockchain analytics to provide predictive insights into user behaviors. By analyzing on-chain data, the tool can adeptly anticipates market trends and user behavior. This comprehensive tool not only deciphers current user interactions but also sets a new standard in forecasting future activities within the blockchain space, making it an indispensable asset for investors, project owners and analysts alike.

All of our content created for the hackathon can be accessed on [this Notion page](https://mathis-hyperia-labs.notion.site/Solana-x-Encode-Hackaton-Hyperia-Labs-2ca5f80b93f1402a8ab1244b53ad0541), including videos, pitch decks, technical paper and more.

## Where can I start reviewing this project?

### Getting data to train the IA
*To train our AI, we used data from all wallets on the Solana blockchain with more than 50 transactions. This encompasses over 150,000 wallets, providing a comprehensive dataset for our advanced learning processes.*

All of the scripts used to get the data can be found in the [extract-data folder](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/extract-data)

### Data
Little informations of the data. You can check the [data](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/data) and the [technical paper](#)

### AI Model
Little informations of the AI model. You can check the [AI model](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/ai) and the [technical paper](#)
