# Hyperia Labs Behavioral Prediction Tool

This is our participation in the [Solana x Encode Hackaton](https://www.encode.club/encodesolanahack)!

## Overview

Hyperia Labs presents an advanced Behavioral Prediction. Tool that employs Deep Learning, Deep Neural network and Blockchain analytics to provide predictive insights into user behaviors. By analyzing on-chain data, the tool can adeptly anticipates market trends and user behavior. This comprehensive tool not only deciphers current user interactions but also sets a new standard in forecasting future activities within the blockchain space, making it an indispensable asset for investors, project owners and analysts alike.

All of our content created for the hackathon can be accessed on [this Notion page](https://mathis-hyperia-labs.notion.site/Solana-x-Encode-Hackaton-Hyperia-Labs-2ca5f80b93f1402a8ab1244b53ad0541), including videos, pitch decks, technical paper and more.

## Where can I start reviewing this project?

### Getting data to train the IA
To train our AI, we used data from all wallets that had interactions with the blockchain during September 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023 (3 months). We get only 1 Go of data because the total for all wallets have interact during this 3 months is equal to 4 000 Go. This is enough to train a first AI model but for more reliability we will need more resources.

All of the scripts used to get the data can be found in the [extract-data folder](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/extract-data)

### Data
Little informations of the data. You can check the [data](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/data)

### AI Model
Little informations of the AI model. You can check the [AI model](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/ai) and the [technical paper](#)
