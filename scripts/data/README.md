## Overview
This repository contains code for transforming JSON files into a structured pandas DataFrame. The primary function of this code is to facilitate comprehensive data analysis and the development of predictive models within the blockchain domain.

## Data Structure
The resulting DataFrame organizes the data where each row corresponds to a unique blockchain transaction. This format is ideal for detailed examination and manipulation of the transaction data.

## Contextual Labeling
For better analysis and interpretability, the code includes functionality to label transactions with descriptive categories such as real estate, DeFi, NFT, etc. These labels are derived from the interaction of the transactions with specific tokens and contracts, providing essential context.

## Usage
To use this code:

Ensure you have pandas and any other required libraries installed in your Python environment.
Place your JSON files in the designated input directory.
Run the script to convert JSON data into a pandas DataFrame.
The labeled DataFrame will be available for your data analysis and model-building activities.
