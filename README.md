# Hyperia Labs Behavioral Prediction Tool

This is our participation in the [Solana x Encode Hackaton](https://www.encode.club/encodesolanahack)!

## Overview

Hyperia Labs introduces its pioneering Behavioral Prediction Tool, a solution designed to decipher and anticipate the actions and trends within the blockchain space. By harnessing powerful AI algorithms like Deep Neural Network Analysis, this tool sifts through complex on-chain data to provide a holistic view of user behaviors and preferences. This multifaceted approach enables more accurate forecasting of market liquidity, user interaction trends, and the potential for fraudulent activities.

All of our content created for the hackathon can be accessed on [this Notion page](https://mathis-hyperia-labs.notion.site/Solana-x-Encode-Hackaton-Hyperia-Labs-2ca5f80b93f1402a8ab1244b53ad0541), including videos, pitch decks, business cases, and more.

## Where can I start reviewing this project?

### Getting data to train the IA
*To train our AI, we used data from all wallets on the Solana blockchain with more than 50 transactions. This encompasses over 150,000 wallets, providing a comprehensive dataset for our advanced learning processes.*

All of the scripts used to get the data can be found in the [extract-data folder](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/extract-data)

### Data
Little informations of the data. You can check the [data](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/data) and the [technical paper](#)

### AI Model
Little informations of the AI model. You can check the [AI model](https://github.com/HyperiaLabs/solana-hackathon-encode/tree/main/scripts/ai) and the [technical paper](#)
